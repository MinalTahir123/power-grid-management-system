# power-grid-management-system
This repository hosts the Power Grid Management System project developed for the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) in Pakistan. The CPPA acts as a critical link between electricity generation companies and distribution companies (DISCOs), managing the procurement and distribution of electricity. This system aims to enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and security of CPPAâ€™s operations by streamlining processes across various departments, including financial, billing, and technical. Key features include reduced manual documentation, minimized errors, improved data access and integrity, and efficient billing dispute resolution. The system is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL, offering robust data management, efficient search functionalities, role-based access control, customized invoice generation, real-time payment tracking, and automated notifications. This project promises significant improvements in the reliability and efficiency of electricity distribution in Pakistan
